# Vision Document: Whisk AI â€“ LLM-Powered Shopping, Meal, and Event Planning App

## Introduction

This document outlines the vision for Whisk AI, an innovative application powered by Large Language Model (LLM) technology, focused on providing users with seamless planning, meal preparation, and shopping experiences tailored to their personal events, culinary preferences, and budget constraints.

## Vision Statement

Whisk AI aims to revolutionize shopping, meal, and event planning by leveraging advanced LLM technology, enabling users to effortlessly plan culturally specific, budget-conscious meals and events, automate procurement from local grocery and retail stores via available APIs, and efficiently manage meal preparation schedules.

## Problem Statement

Traditional shopping, meal, and event planning can be tedious, time-consuming, and challenging, especially when managing culturally authentic meals, personal events, or celebrations within a specific budget. Existing shopping and meal-planning apps lack comprehensive, intelligent event-planning capabilities linked directly to automatic purchasing integrations and timely cooking reminders.

## Target Users

The primary users are busy individuals, families, event planners, culinary enthusiasts, and culturally-focused consumers (e.g., individuals seeking authentic cuisine or detailed event planning).

## Core Features

- **LLM-Powered Planning:**
    
    - Users specify event types (e.g., birthday parties), dietary preferences (e.g., Japanese cuisine), or general event and shopping requirements.
    - Automatic generation of comprehensive, contextually relevant, and budget-aware plans.
- **Meal Planning and Recipe Management:**
    
    - Storage of personalized recipes and meal plans.
    - Scheduled reminders for meal preparation aligned with user meal plans.
- **Interactive Feedback Loop:**
    
    - Users provide feedback to dynamically modify lists, plans, and recipes by adding or removing suggested items.
    - LLM intelligently adapts plans based on user input.
- **Automatic List Generation:**
    
    - Conversion of event and meal plans into optimized shopping lists aligned with local availability and pricing.
- **Store Integration:**
    
    - Seamless integration with local grocery and retail stores via APIs (e.g., Fred Meyer, Walmart).
    - Automatic population and checkout of shopping carts.
    - Intelligent handling of cases without available APIs through practical workarounds.
- **Budget Management:**
    
    - Ensuring generated plans and shopping lists strictly adhere to the user's stated budget.
    - Dynamic adjustments to maintain budget integrity.
- **Voice-Based Interaction:**
    
    - Hands-free interactions for planning meals or events using voice commands and receiving verbal suggestions.
- **Community-Driven Content:**
    
    - Users can create, publish, and share their own recipes or event plans, enhancing community engagement and content diversity.

## Technical Approach

- **LLM Integration:** Leveraging LLM technology to accurately interpret user requests and dynamically generate event, meal plans, and cooking schedules.
- **API-driven Shopping Automation:** Utilizing store APIs for automated product selection and purchasing.
- **Fallback Mechanisms:** Developing alternative ordering or purchasing solutions in the absence of direct store APIs (e.g., online order automation).

## Benefits

- **Convenience:** Simplifies meal planning, event preparation, and shopping.
- **Customization:** Tailored culinary and event-planning experiences.
- **Cost-Efficiency:** Optimizes spending within specified budgets.
- **Time Saving:** Automates the purchasing process and provides timely reminders for meal preparation, significantly saving user time.

## Future Expansion Opportunities

- Extended planning scenarios (e.g., weddings, holiday gatherings, corporate events).
- Enhanced dietary and lifestyle customization options (e.g., vegan, keto, gluten-free).
- Integration with delivery services for home delivery.
- Expansion of store partnerships and geographic coverage.
- Social collaboration and sharing features for collective planning.
- Real-time inventory management integration with smart home devices.
- Smart nutritional insights for healthier meal planning.
- User-driven review and rating systems to refine suggestions.
- Sustainability and ethical shopping options.
- Predictive analytics and proactive reminders for recurring events and staple item reordering.

## Conclusion

Whisk AI aims to redefine how consumers plan, shop, prepare meals, and experience events, transforming everyday activities into effortless, culturally enriched, and budget-conscious experiences.
