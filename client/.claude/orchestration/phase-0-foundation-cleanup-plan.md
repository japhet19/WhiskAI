# Phase 0: Foundation Cleanup Orchestration Plan

## Goal: Prepare WhiskAI codebase for MVP implementation
**Duration**: 1-2 days
**Status**: Completed

## Goal Scope Definition
**In Scope:**
- Setting up proper project structure
- Installing required dependencies
- Creating environment configuration templates
- Setting up code quality tools (ESLint, Prettier)
- Creating basic CI/CD pipeline

**Out of Scope:**
- Implementing any user-facing features
- Modifying existing chat functionality
- Backend API implementation
- Database setup

## Major Phases

### Phase 1: Project Structure Setup
**Objective**: Organize project for scalable development
**Status**: Completed
**Deliverables:**
- Organized folder structure following React best practices
- Clear separation of concerns
- Module organization

**Actions:**
- CREATE_TASK: Analyze current project structure and create reorganization plan [TASK-001 - Completed]
- CREATE_TASK: Create missing directories for organized development [TASK-002 - Completed]
- CREATE_TASK: Move existing files to appropriate locations [TASK-003 - Completed]

### Phase 2: Dependencies Installation
**Objective**: Install all required packages for MVP development
**Status**: Completed
**Deliverables:**
- Updated package.json with all dependencies
- Lock file updated
- No version conflicts

**Actions:**
- CREATE_TASK: Install React Router and related navigation dependencies [TASK-004 - Completed]
- CREATE_TASK: Install Tailwind CSS and configure for project [TASK-005 - Completed]
- CREATE_TASK: Install Framer Motion for animations [TASK-006 - Completed]
- CREATE_TASK: Install React Query for API state management [TASK-007 - Completed]
- CREATE_TASK: Install development dependencies (testing libraries, types) [TASK-008 - Completed]

### Phase 3: Code Quality Setup
**Objective**: Establish consistent code standards
**Status**: Completed
**Deliverables:**
- ESLint configuration
- Prettier configuration
- Pre-commit hooks
- Editor config

**Actions:**
- CREATE_TASK: Create and configure ESLint for TypeScript React [TASK-009 - Completed]
- CREATE_TASK: Setup Prettier with project conventions [TASK-010 - Completed]
- CREATE_TASK: Configure Husky for pre-commit hooks [TASK-011 - Completed]
- CREATE_TASK: Create .editorconfig for consistent formatting [TASK-012 - Completed]

### Phase 4: Environment Configuration
**Objective**: Setup secure environment variable management
**Status**: Completed
**Deliverables:**
- .env.example file with all required variables
- Environment validation
- Documentation for env setup

**Actions:**
- CREATE_TASK: Create .env.example with all required environment variables [TASK-013 - Completed]
- CREATE_TASK: Document environment variable requirements in README [Skipped - User has .env configured]
- USER_ACTION: Review and confirm environment variables are appropriate [Confirmed - GEMINI_API_KEY and SPOONACULAR_API_KEY]

### Phase 5: CI/CD Pipeline
**Objective**: Automate testing and deployment
**Status**: Completed
**Deliverables:**
- GitHub Actions workflow
- Automated tests on PR
- Build verification
- Deploy configuration

**Actions:**
- CREATE_TASK: Create GitHub Actions workflow for testing [TASK-014 - Completed]
- CREATE_TASK: Setup build verification in CI [TASK-015 - Completed]
- CREATE_TASK: Configure deployment pipeline (if deployment target known) [Skipped - No deployment target specified]
- USER_ACTION: Review and approve CI/CD configuration [Pending]

## Key Dependencies
- Phase 2 depends on Phase 1 completion (need structure before installing deps)
- Phase 3 can run in parallel with Phase 2
- Phase 4 can start anytime
- Phase 5 depends on Phases 2 and 3 (needs deps and linting for CI)

## Resource Needs Assessment
- Node.js and npm/yarn installed
- GitHub repository access for CI/CD
- Environment variable values from user
- Deployment target information (for CI/CD)

## Critical Risks and Timeline Impacts
1. **Dependency Conflicts**: Some packages might have version conflicts
   - Mitigation: Use exact versions, test incrementally
2. **Breaking Changes**: Moving files might break imports
   - Mitigation: Update imports systematically, test after each move
3. **CI/CD Complexity**: GitHub Actions might need specific configuration
   - Mitigation: Start with simple workflow, enhance iteratively

## Parallelization Opportunities
- Environment configuration (Phase 4) can run in parallel with other phases
- ESLint and Prettier setup can be done simultaneously
- Documentation updates can happen throughout

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All dependencies installed without conflicts
- [ ] ESLint and Prettier configured and working
- [ ] Pre-commit hooks catching issues
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline passing on main branch
- [ ] Environment variables documented
- [ ] Project structure organized and scalable

## Implementation Order
1. Start with project structure (Phase 1)
2. Install dependencies (Phase 2)
3. Setup code quality tools (Phase 3) - can start in parallel with late Phase 2
4. Configure environment (Phase 4) - can start anytime
5. Setup CI/CD (Phase 5) - after 2 & 3 complete

## Notes
- Keep the app working throughout - test after each major change
- Commit after each successful phase
- Document any decisions or deviations from plan
