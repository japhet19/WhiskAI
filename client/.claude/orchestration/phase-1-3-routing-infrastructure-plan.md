# Phase 1.3: Routing Infrastructure Orchestration Plan

## Goal: Complete Phase 1.3 routing infrastructure from Core Infrastructure plan
**Duration**: 2-3 days
**Status**: Not Started
**Working State**: Chat interface remains fully functional, routing added progressively

## Goal Scope Definition
**In Scope:**
- Route configuration and constants
- Layout component with navigation structure
- ProtectedRoute component for future authentication
- App.tsx integration with React Router
- Navigation utilities and hooks
- Maintaining existing chat functionality

**Out of Scope:**
- Authentication implementation (routes prepared only)
- New pages/views beyond chat
- Backend routing or API endpoints
- Complex route animations (basic only)

## Major Phases

### Phase 1.3.1: Route Configuration Setup
**Objective**: Create foundational route configuration and constants
**Status**: Not Started
**Deliverables:**
- Route constants and types
- Route configuration object
- Path utilities

**Actions:**
- CREATE_TASK: Create route constants and TypeScript interfaces
- CREATE_TASK: Set up route configuration with path utilities
- CREATE_TASK: Create route types for type safety

### Phase 1.3.2: Layout Component Implementation  
**Objective**: Build main layout component with navigation structure
**Status**: Not Started
**Deliverables:**
- Layout component with header/main/footer structure
- Navigation component with route links
- Responsive design using design system

**Actions:**
- CREATE_TASK: Create Layout component with responsive structure
- CREATE_TASK: Implement Navigation component with route links
- CREATE_TASK: Apply design system tokens to layout components
- CREATE_TASK: Add proper semantic HTML and accessibility

### Phase 1.3.3: Route Guards and Protection
**Objective**: Implement ProtectedRoute component for future authentication
**Status**: Not Started  
**Deliverables:**
- ProtectedRoute wrapper component
- Route guard logic (prepared for auth)
- Redirect utilities

**Actions:**
- CREATE_TASK: Create ProtectedRoute component with auth placeholder
- CREATE_TASK: Implement route guard logic for future onboarding
- CREATE_TASK: Create redirect utilities and hooks

### Phase 1.3.4: App Router Integration
**Objective**: Update App.tsx to use React Router while preserving chat
**Status**: Not Started
**Deliverables:**
- Updated App.tsx with BrowserRouter
- Route definitions for chat and future pages
- Fallback routes and error boundaries

**Actions:**
- CREATE_TASK: Update App.tsx to implement BrowserRouter
- CREATE_TASK: Define route structure with chat as default
- CREATE_TASK: Add fallback routes and 404 handling
- CREATE_TASK: Test that existing chat functionality works unchanged

### Phase 1.3.5: Navigation Utilities
**Objective**: Create navigation hooks and utilities for the app
**Status**: Not Started
**Deliverables:**
- useNavigation custom hook
- Route-based utilities
- Navigation context (if needed)

**Actions:**
- CREATE_TASK: Create useNavigation hook with route utilities
- CREATE_TASK: Implement navigation utilities for programmatic routing
- CREATE_TASK: Add breadcrumb utilities (for future use)
- CREATE_TASK: Create comprehensive tests for routing utilities

## Key Dependencies
- React Router DOM v6.30.1 (already installed)
- Design system tokens from Phase 1.1 (completed)
- Context providers from Phase 1.2 (completed)  
- Must preserve existing ChatInterface functionality
- Layout components depend on route configuration
- App integration depends on Layout and ProtectedRoute components

## Resource Needs Assessment
**Technical Requirements:**
- React Router v6 documentation for best practices
- Design system tokens for consistent styling
- Accessibility guidelines for navigation
- TypeScript interfaces for type safety

**Testing Requirements:**
- React Testing Library for component tests
- React Router testing utilities
- Mock router for unit tests

## Critical Risks and Timeline Impacts
1. **Breaking Chat Interface**: Major risk of disrupting working functionality
   - Mitigation: Implement routing around existing chat, test continuously
   - Timeline Impact: Could delay by 1-2 days if chat breaks

2. **Route Configuration Complexity**: Over-engineering early routing
   - Mitigation: Start simple, follow YAGNI principle
   - Timeline Impact: Minimal if kept focused

3. **Layout Component Integration**: Design system conflicts
   - Mitigation: Use existing design tokens, test with current components
   - Timeline Impact: 0.5 day delay possible

## Parallelization Opportunities
- Route configuration can be built while Layout component is designed
- Navigation utilities can be developed alongside ProtectedRoute component
- Testing can be written in parallel with implementation
- Documentation can be updated as each phase completes

## Implementation Strategy

### Progressive Enhancement Approach
1. **Phase 1**: Build routing foundation without changing App.tsx
2. **Phase 2**: Create Layout/Navigation components in isolation  
3. **Phase 3**: Implement route guards as no-op wrappers initially
4. **Phase 4**: Carefully integrate routing into App.tsx, preserving chat
5. **Phase 5**: Add utilities and finalize implementation

### Rollback Plan
- Each phase includes verification that chat still works
- Commit after each working phase
- Keep routing optional until final integration
- Maintain current App.tsx as backup until confirmed working

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Chat interface continues working exactly as before
- [ ] Route configuration is type-safe and extensible
- [ ] Layout component follows design system
- [ ] ProtectedRoute prepared for future authentication
- [ ] App.tsx successfully uses React Router
- [ ] Navigation utilities are comprehensive and tested
- [ ] All new code has >80% test coverage
- [ ] No TypeScript errors or linting issues
- [ ] Performance impact is minimal

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for all utilities and hooks
- Component tests for Layout and Navigation
- Integration tests for routing behavior
- E2E test to verify chat functionality preserved
- Performance testing for routing overhead

## Documentation Updates
- Update architecture.md with routing decisions
- Document route configuration patterns
- Create examples for future page additions
- Update contributing guidelines for routing

---

## Implementation Notes
- Follow "Always Shippable" principle - every commit should leave app working
- Use feature flags or conditional rendering if needed during integration
- Prioritize TypeScript safety for route definitions
- Keep navigation simple initially, enhance later
- Document all architectural decisions for future reference
