# Phase 1: Core Infrastructure Orchestration Plan

## Goal: Implement design system and state management as per MVP-Phase-1-Infrastructure.md
**Duration**: 1-2 weeks
**Status**: In Progress
**Working State**: Chat interface remains fully functional, new features hidden until complete

## Goal Scope Definition
**In Scope:**
- Design system with Tailwind configuration and tokens
- Global state management with Context API
- React Router setup with route guards
- Animation components
- Testing infrastructure

**Out of Scope:**
- User-facing features (landing page, onboarding)
- API integrations beyond existing Gemini
- Backend development

## Major Phases

### Phase 1.1: Design System
**Objective**: Create comprehensive design system with tokens and components
**Status**: Completed
**Deliverables:**
- Design tokens for colors, spacing, typography
- Global styles with Tailwind
- Animation components (FadeSlideUp, ScalePop)
- Base UI components

**Actions:**
- CREATE_TASK: Create design tokens file with color, spacing, typography
- CREATE_TASK: Configure Tailwind with custom design tokens
- CREATE_TASK: Create animation components (FadeSlideUp, ScalePop)
- CREATE_TASK: Apply design system to existing ChatInterface
- USER_ACTION: Review design system implementation

### Phase 1.2: State Management
**Objective**: Implement global state management with Context API
**Status**: Not Started
**Deliverables:**
- AppContext with user preferences
- useLocalStorage hook
- State for recipes, meal plans, shopping lists
- Context providers

**Actions:**
- CREATE_TASK: Create useLocalStorage custom hook
- CREATE_TASK: Implement AppContext with TypeScript interfaces
- CREATE_TASK: Create UserPreferences context and provider
- CREATE_TASK: Create RecipeContext for recipe state management
- CREATE_TASK: Create MealPlanContext for meal planning state

### Phase 1.3: Routing Infrastructure
**Objective**: Set up React Router with proper structure
**Status**: Not Started
**Deliverables:**
- Route configuration
- Layout component
- Route guards for onboarding
- Navigation utilities

**Actions:**
- CREATE_TASK: Create route configuration and constants
- CREATE_TASK: Implement Layout component with navigation
- CREATE_TASK: Create ProtectedRoute component for auth guards
- CREATE_TASK: Set up route structure in App.tsx
- CREATE_TASK: Create navigation utilities and hooks

### Phase 1.4: Testing Infrastructure
**Objective**: Set up comprehensive testing utilities
**Status**: Not Started
**Deliverables:**
- Testing utilities and helpers
- Test templates
- Context test wrappers
- Sample tests

**Actions:**
- CREATE_TASK: Create testing utilities and render helpers
- CREATE_TASK: Create test templates for components
- CREATE_TASK: Write tests for custom hooks
- CREATE_TASK: Write tests for context providers
- CREATE_TASK: Ensure 80%+ coverage for new code

## Key Dependencies
- Phase 1.1 (Design System) should complete first as it affects all UI
- Phase 1.2 (State Management) can start in parallel
- Phase 1.3 (Routing) depends on Layout component from 1.1
- Phase 1.4 (Testing) can progress alongside other phases

## Resource Needs Assessment
- MVP Phase 1 documentation for reference
- Tailwind CSS documentation
- React Router v6 documentation
- React Testing Library documentation

## Critical Risks and Timeline Impacts
1. **Design Token Integration**: Ensuring smooth integration with Tailwind
   - Mitigation: Test incrementally with existing components
2. **State Management Complexity**: Context API might become complex
   - Mitigation: Start simple, consider Redux if needed later
3. **Breaking Changes**: Must keep chat interface working
   - Mitigation: Feature flag new routes, test thoroughly

## Parallelization Opportunities
- Design tokens and useLocalStorage hook can be developed simultaneously
- Animation components can be built while state management is in progress
- Testing utilities can be created early and used throughout

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Chat interface still works throughout development
- [ ] Design system applied consistently
- [ ] State management working with persistence
- [ ] Routing infrastructure ready for new pages
- [ ] All new code has tests with >80% coverage
- [ ] No TypeScript errors
- [ ] All linting passes

## Implementation Notes
- Keep existing chat functionality intact
- Use feature flags or conditional rendering for new routes
- Document all design decisions
- Create Storybook stories for new components (stretch goal)
