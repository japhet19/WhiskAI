# TASK-009: Create and configure ESLint for TypeScript React

## Status: Completed
## Priority: High
## Created: 2025-01-22
## Assigned: Claude

## Description
Configure ESLint for the WhiskAI project with TypeScript and React support. Create React App includes ESLint, but we need to ensure it's properly configured.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Check existing ESLint configuration
- [x] Create/update .eslintrc configuration if needed
- [x] Add custom rules for code consistency
- [x] Test ESLint is working
- [x] Fix any existing linting errors

## Configuration Requirements
- TypeScript support
- React hooks rules
- Import order rules
- No console.log in production
- Consistent code style

## Notes
- CRA includes ESLint but may need custom configuration
- Should work with Prettier (next task)
