# Architecture Overview

## Guiding Principles:
- [e.g., Scalability, Maintainability, Security, Simplicity]
- [To be defined as the project evolves]

## Key Technologies / Stack:
- **Frontend:** [e.g., React, Vue, Angular, Vanilla JS] - *To be decided*
- **Backend:** [e.g., Node.js/Express, Python/Django, Java/Spring Boot] - *To be decided*
- **Database:** [e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL] - *To be decided*
- **Deployment:** [e.g., Docker, Kubernetes, Serverless (AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions), Netlify, Vercel] - *To be decided*
- **Version Control:** Git (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket)
- **Project Management:** Claude Code PM System

## High-Level Components:
*(This section will evolve. Start with broad ideas and refine.)*
- **User Interface (UI):** [Brief description of responsibilities]
- **API Layer:** [Brief description of responsibilities]
- **Business Logic Layer:** [Brief description of responsibilities]
- **Data Persistence Layer:** [Brief description of responsibilities]
- **Authentication/Authorization Service:** [Brief description of responsibilities]

## Data Models (Initial Thoughts):
*(Very high-level, to be detailed later)*
- **User:** [Key attributes, e.g., id, username, email, password_hash]
- **[Primary Entity 1]:** [Key attributes]

## External Integrations / APIs:
- [API 1, e.g., Stripe for payments] - *If applicable*
- [API 2, e.g., SendGrid for emails] - *If applicable*
